# [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.cn/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

## Level
**Medium**


## Question

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 9
* It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Answer
### Solution

The linked list is like reversing the digits of a number, so we can traverse it in order and add corresponding digits.
When either l1 or l2 finishes traversing, we directly set l3.Next to the remaining list, and pay attention to the carry.
